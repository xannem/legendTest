### Action Items

- Discussion Points: 
Group walked through the proposed changes that are required to be able to capture multiple fixed payments appropriately. Proposal outlined a distinct commodityPayout class that would allow for this scenario to be captured.

Group agreed on the roadmap to the end of the pilot with the remaining weeks split into 2 different stages. The core deliverables we will be aiming for in the coming weeks are; Agree on Reference Data Model structure, look to capture any additional scenarios in the commodityPayout for financial scenarios, agree on best way to represent commodityPayout in the CDM, review qualifier functions needed for Commodities in CDM & agree on industry next steps. 

Takeaway: 

Changes to be proposed in Alloy in line with the proposal from the first agenda item.
