### Agenda Item #1
* Introductions of the Group
* We will re-cover the content next week with all participants present but a short summary of the discussion points that may help.

### Agenda Item #2
#### Problem Statement
*	Not a clear separation of contractual data v reference (price) data in the current FpML construct for Commodities
*	Current fPML schema restricts the information that you can give around specific commodities and not flexible to cater for new industry data demands/categorisation. 
*	Want to agree an industry model that can be stored externally to the contractual (transactional) model however there will be dependency between the two on a contractual basis. 
*	Improve external communication intrabank/regulation

#### What do we mean by separation
*	Reference Data – published prices/indices, publication info. 

#### Nuances of commod swaps v eq return swap
*	Mulitple leg types dependant on the type of i) transaction and ii) product
*	Physical legs contain additional information around the physical commodity in question (Example given on the call ‘Pipeline’ is specified for Physical Oil).
* Example FpML
