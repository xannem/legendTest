## Agenda

### Agenda item #1
Reference Data Model in Alloy discussion: Look to get agreement on modelling of physical v benchmark commodities - Shaun/Manveen (GS)/ All


### AOB


### Action Items

Discussion Points:

This week the group walked through some sample scenarios of the commodity products and looked at what data is needed to be able to accurately capture the properties. The driver behind this material being created was to give some further context to the group as we are considering the different commodities product model proposals. As the group talked through the examples there was healthy discussion on the best way for this data to be modelled and whether there should be 2 distinct object between benchmark & physical commodity. Without agreement, there was attention given to what properties are common across the 2 types and a suggestion came that an alternative way of detailing the relationship could be to model by association rather than being a property of one another. Discussion to continue next week.
