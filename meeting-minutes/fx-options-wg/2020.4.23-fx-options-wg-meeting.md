### Action items
Summary of Meeting:
* Ted(ISDA) took the group through an example vanilla Fx Option showing how it is modelled in CDM and the JSON output for it.
* Classes/Attributes reviewed: Metadata Keys for Parties (Global vs External), TradableProduct (quantityNotation and priceNotation), OptionPayout (currency classes, optionType, expirationDate, strike) and ProductQualification Functions.
* Re strike class, CDM FxOption model does not currently have a strike unit (currency) - group proposed four solutions for this:
    1. PutCurrencyPerCallCurrency / CallCurrencyPerPutCurrency
    2. OptionCurrencyperCounterCurrency / CounterCurrencyperOptionCurrency
    3. String to be populated with the currency pair in the order quoted (denominator per numerator)
    4. exchangedCurrency1per exchangedCurrency2 / exchangedCurrency2per exchangedCurrency1

Next Steps:
* Group to review strike unit proposals and agree in next session on preferred solution. Solution code to then be implemented via AlloyStudio.
* Group to review any other classes Ted presented on offline and discuss any further questions in the next session. 
* Agenda Items #2 and #3 from above to be pushed to next session.
