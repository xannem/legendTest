### Action items
Summary of Discussion
* *Currency Data Standardisation*: The WG explored the use of the Securities Reference Data project (led by Sailesh from the Nomura team) and reviewed POC modelling in Studio for the currency data ask. The reference database would be a cloud based centralised ledger from which APIs can be created to retrieve reference data. The database would be open source along with updating and maintaining it. No objections were raised in the WG and next step is to connect with ISDA, Barclays and Bloomberg who are interested in the topic. Useful initial links:

  * Securities Ref Data/Finos Project Page: https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DT/pages/1670774789/Currency+-+Defining+standard+Object 
  * Draft Alloy Studio submission: https://alloy.finos.org/studio/review/UAT-33/18

* *Abstract Trigger Mapping and Testing*: Ajith (DB) took the WG through live testing in Studio of the previously submitted and merged *Trigger* abstraction. Some pre-exisiting constraints within the CDM model were discussed and proposed to review with ISDA/RegNosis on approach for these, but all other *Trigger* abstraction tests passed successfully, which closes off the full scope of modelling, submission and testing for Stage 1 of the pilot.  

Next Steps
* Lifecycle Events Classes Analysis: Novations to be explored in next session - Ted (ISDA)
* Currency Data Standardisation: Offline meet to discuss with interested particpants on approach - Vijay
