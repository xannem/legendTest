## Agenda

### Agenda item #1
Reference Data Model in Alloy discussion: Look to get agreement on modelling of physical v benchmark commodities - Shaun/Manveen (GS)/ All

### Agenda item #2
ISDA Taxonomy 2.0 - Karel/Ted (ISDA)

### AOB
Discussion Points:
Agenda Item 1: Group talked through the existing product model that is in Alloy and what steps need to be taken to be able to come to an agreement with respect to how to model benchmark & physical commodities. Progress was made and it was identified that a potential solution that would satisfy the group would be to in the relationship of physical Commodity to the Benchmark, whilst keeping them as 2 distinct class. Next session we will talk through some exampes for both of these product types and how they would be represent in this proposed change. 

Agenda Item 2: Karel <ISDA> walked us through the proposed ISDA Taxonomy 2.0 for Commodities. The group were shown how Commodities Reference Price (CRP) has been added into the design of the taxonomy and that it also allows you to specify the Commodity in more granular detail than previously e.g. V2 taxonomy allows specification of 'Aluminum' however V1 would only allow 'non'precious'. The conversation touched on the reliance of the qualifier functions in the ISDA CDM model and how that would apply in Commodities - something that will require further thought in coming weeks. 
  
Action Items:
- Prepare different product exampes in the proposed underlier model for next session (Shaun, GS)
- Provide further information around qualifier fucntions and relationship with ISDA taxonomy (Ted, ISDA) - Complete
