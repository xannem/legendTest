### Action Items

Discussion:

Ted (ISDA) walked the group through how the WTI Oil Swap use case could be integrated into the existing CDM framework. Using the existing Equities payout we are able to create a Commodities payout with the addition of a handful features. 

Next Steps:

Changes are to be made to the CDM model in Alloy to be able to reflect the Commodities payout as agreed by the group (GS to action)
