Group discussed abstract concepts including the *TransferPrimitive* which refer to fees, payments etc; *meta global keys* which link different event messages; and the *contractFormationPrimitive* that details 'before' and 'after' data. For Partial Terminations  the *QuantityChange* class was reviewed which contains pre and post quantity amounts from which quantity delta can be inferred, and the *Exercise* class used for Exercise events.
